I had the chance to attend an internal workshop on Giving & Receiving Feedback a few months ago and I found it excellent. I canâ€™t recommend the topic enough!

One of the biggest realizations for me is how feedback doesnâ€™t have to be this big and ominous word. Itâ€™s not something we should leave until we get that ping scheduled request once a year and then spend days with the thoughts consuming our mental capacity until we finally decide to block a whole afternoon to do it. At least that was my approach to it and I realize how I was making things harder than they need to be.

So I ask for your help to demystify feedback (team mates, friends or family). What do I mean by that? I would like to take the heaviness out of it and make it so natural we wonâ€™t even notice it when itâ€™s happening. Letâ€™s celebrate each other wins and letâ€™s help each other when we make mistakes. We are human after all ðŸ™‚.

In the feedback workshop we used the Situation-Behaviour-Impact model. There is a lot of content online ([here is a short article about it](https://medium.com/pm101/the-situation-behavior-impact-feedback-framework-e20ce52c9357)) but the gist of it can be seen with an example. Imagine I receive the following message in slack:

* **Situation**: Leo, I was catching up on messages and stumbled upon your post about improving conversion rates for our business plan.
* **Behaviour**: I noticed a very high use of the words _lit_ and _fam_. There are 17 occurrences of them in two paragraphs.
* **Impact**: I worry that an overuse of colloquialisms might detract from the message and even reflect poorly on the team as unprofessional.

If I see this kind of message I am going to thank you! It would be a great way to start a conversation on how, for instance, I am trying to communicate with a younger audience (and failing from the looks of it ðŸ˜…). It also shows me that you care about me and have my best interests in mind. You want to help me be perceived in a professional way. I am not going to get upset and I would be super curious about it. I would love to learn more about your point of view!

The last example was about constructive feedback but the framework works great for positive feedback too:

* **Situation**: Cait, I attended the presentation you did about our new data modelling layer.
* **Behaviour**: The communication and examples you used were excellent. In particular the example about a cat being its own dimension.
* **Impact**: Itâ€™s the first time I really understand this concept. I was really glad I could make it to the meeting and I am excited to give this modelling a try.
So where do we go form here? letâ€™s practice! We could start slowly. For instance, ask another team member if they are open for some feedback (this step might induce a little bit of anxiety, I know it does for me). Use this post as an excuse to practice ðŸ™‚. If you are open to receiving feedback, please let your team members know too!

I am very open to it and if you want to practice I will be more than happy to be your feedback buddy!

I really appreciate the feedback I get. It serves as positive reinforcement, it helps me find out some blindspots, it makes me revaluate some beliefs, it tells me that people care and itâ€™s a great starting point for many conversations. Please do not hesitate to share it with me!
