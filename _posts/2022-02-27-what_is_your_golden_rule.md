I was recently reading the [Bobiverse series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/192752-bobiverse)â€“a very geeky and entertaining sci-fi sagaâ€“where the main character has contact with other civilizations. At some point in a conversation, our protagonist mentions the golden rule:

> Treat others the way **you** want to be treated.

It was very interesting to see how the friendly alien says that is not their golden rule but their silver rule. Their golden rule is:

> Treat others the way **they** want to be treated.

I am always open to new lessons and this one was mind-boggling.

Now I wonder in how many occasions I have treated others the way I wanted to be treated without realizing that was a completely wrong approach.

Please take this as a reminder that even if we have the best intentions, our actions might not translate as well as we think.

* Assume positive intent
* Be kind
* Ask for what you need

Please help me out by being very explicit about what you need. Do you want me to play the role of a coach and make open ended-questions? do you want suggestions on a technical issue? do you want me to keep quiet and listen to you? do you want my opinion? please be as open and clear as you can. I want to help and if I have to guess, chances are I will get it wrong ðŸ™‚
